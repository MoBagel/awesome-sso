<!-- Hello! Thanks for submitting a PR. To help make things go a bit more
     smoothly we would appreciate that you go through this template. -->

### Description

<!-- Good things to put here include: reasoning for the change (please link
     any relevant issues!), any noteworthy (or hacky) choices to be aware of,
     or what the problem resolved here looked like ... we won't mind a ranty
     story :) -->

### Checklist - did you ...

<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution
     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.

    All user-facing changes should get an entry. Otherwise, signal to us
    this should get the magical label to silence the CHANGELOG entry check.
    Tests are required for bugfixes and new features. Documentation changes
    are necessary for formatting and most enhancement changes. -->

- [ ] Ran `poe format`, passed `poe lint` and `poe test`?
